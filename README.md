# Burger-App
## [Click me](https://myburger-65958.web.app/) and check out this Project!
### I coded this along a 40h Tutorial from _Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller_.
#### This project only has functional components, uses Redux, Routing and is connected to a Database on Firebase.

## Things i learned: 
* Redux
* Input-Validation
* Folder-Structure
* Storing & Retrieving data on Firebase/RealtimeDatabase

## Things i can still learn from this Project: 
* Codestructure 
* ErrorHandling - Still kinda abstract for me 
* LocalStorage/SessionStorage usage
* Redux - Best practices


###### Some thoughts on this project:
######  I started this Tutorial/Project after i had the fundamentals down in js/css/html. I finished the tutorials on [freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org) and watched some videos on YouTube. The code itself wasn't that hard to understand. **The biggest problem** was: _thinking in react._ The tutorial was pretty much this big project. Each new concept got integrated and changed along the way. On the one hand it was very throughout, one the other hand it was hard to follow & comprehend.

###### Now that i am more comfortable with React, this project/tutorial offers some very helpful references where i can improve on.
